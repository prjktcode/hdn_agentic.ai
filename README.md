System Overview: Healthcare Diagnosis Network

This project simulates a decentralized healthcare diagnosis system, where multiple autonomous agents collaborate to diagnose patients under conditions of partial information, conflicting objectives, and limited shared resources.

Each agent uses reinforcement learning (Q-learning) to independently improve diagnosis accuracy while adapting to dynamic environments with agent failures and resource contention. Coordination emerges not from fixed rules, but from agent interactions and shared learning over time.

Core Design Philosophy

Decentralization: No central controller; agents operate autonomously.

Asymmetric Information: Agents only see partial symptom sets and must infer.

Emergence over Engineering: No fixed roles; agents develop behavior through interaction.

Local Learning: Each agent updates its Q-table based on personal diagnosis success.

/architecture/agent_interaction_model.md

Agent Interaction Model

Agents perceive a subset of patient symptoms.

They make individual diagnoses using Q-learning.

Agents can broadcast learned state-action mappings to others (peer gossip).

There is no central state — communication is opportunistic.

/architecture/conflict_resolution.md

Handling Competing Objectives

Agents compete for access to MRI resources.

Each agent has different performance goals (e.g. speed, precision).

Conflicts are resolved implicitly through:

First-come resource claims

Learning which actions maximize local reward

/architecture/emergence_design.md

Emergence from Interactions

Agents specialize based on exposure (e.g., one sees more "stroke" cases).

Diagnoses accuracy improves over time without coordination scripts.

Agents begin to adapt communication patterns for improved global performance.

/demonstration/coordination_scenarios.md

Demonstration Scenarios

Baseline: 4 agents, 30 patients, 2 MRI slots.

High Churn: Agents randomly fail and join.

Resource Starvation: MRI capacity reduced to 1.

Each scenario shows how coordination evolves in changing environments.

/demonstration/failure_modes.md

Failure Handling

Agents marked alive = False randomly.

New agents introduced mid-run.

System continues functioning via active agents and updated Q-learning.

/demonstration/emergent_behaviors.md

Observed Emergent Behaviors

Role-like behavior: some agents become "specialists" in certain conditions.

Learning coordination: accuracy rises as agents explore and exploit shared knowledge.

Coordination without messaging: agents improve simply by learning from each other’s actions.

/analysis/coordination_effectiveness.md

Effectiveness Analysis

Rolling accuracy graphs show increasing trend.

Most agents converge to >80% accuracy within 30 patients.

Gossip communication leads to faster convergence in late-game.

/analysis/scalability_analysis.md

Scalability

4 → 20 agent scalability shows slow degradation in performance.

Increased agents = more competition for MRI, but faster knowledge propagation.

Gossip model is effective for loose coupling.

/analysis/failure_recovery.md

Failure Recovery

When agents fail, short-term dip in accuracy.

New agents begin with fresh Q-tables but learn from peer-shared data.

System maintains functionality even under aggressive churn.

/analysis/alternative_approaches.md

Alternatives Considered

Voting-based consensus: discarded due to overhead and delay.

Central rule-based controller: rejected due to centralization.

Shared state memory: avoided to preserve agent autonomy.
