**System Overview: Healthcare Diagnosis Network**

This project simulates a decentralized healthcare diagnosis system, where multiple autonomous agents collaborate to diagnose patients under conditions of partial information, conflicting objectives, and limited shared resources.

Each agent uses reinforcement learning (Q-learning) to independently improve diagnosis accuracy while adapting to dynamic environments with agent failures and resource contention. Coordination emerges not from fixed rules, but from agent interactions and shared learning over time.

**Core Design Philosophy**

Decentralization: No central controller; agents operate autonomously.
Asymmetric Information: Agents only see partial symptom sets and must infer.
Emergence over Engineering: No fixed roles; agents develop behavior through interaction.
Local Learning: Each agent updates its Q-table based on personal diagnosis success.

*/architecture/agent_interaction_model.md*

**Agent Interaction Model**

Agents perceive a subset of patient symptoms.
They make individual diagnoses using Q-learning.
Agents can broadcast learned state-action mappings to others (peer gossip).
There is no central state — communication is opportunistic.

*/architecture/conflict_resolution.md*

**Handling Competing Objectives**

Agents compete for access to MRI resources.
Each agent has different performance goals (e.g. speed, precision).
Conflicts are resolved implicitly through:
First-come resource claims
Learning which actions maximize local reward

*/architecture/emergence_design.md*

**Emergence from Interactions**

Agents specialize based on exposure (e.g., one sees more "stroke" cases).
Diagnoses accuracy improves over time without coordination scripts.
Agents begin to adapt communication patterns for improved global performance.

*/demonstration/coordination_scenarios.md*

**Demonstration Scenarios**

Baseline: 4 agents, 30 patients, 2 MRI slots.
High Churn: Agents randomly fail and join.
Resource Starvation: MRI capacity reduced to 1.
Each scenario shows how coordination evolves in changing environments.

*/demonstration/failure_modes.md*

**Failure Handling**

Agents marked alive = False randomly.
New agents introduced mid-run.
System continues functioning via active agents and updated Q-learning.

*/demonstration/emergent_behaviors.md*

**Observed Emergent Behaviors**

Role-like behavior: some agents become "specialists" in certain conditions.
Learning coordination: accuracy rises as agents explore and exploit shared knowledge.
Coordination without messaging: agents improve simply by learning from each other’s actions.

*/analysis/coordination_effectiveness.md*

**Effectiveness Analysis**

Rolling accuracy graphs show increasing trend.
Most agents converge to >80% accuracy within 30 patients.
Gossip communication leads to faster convergence in late-game.

*/analysis/scalability_analysis.md*

**Scalability**

4 → 20 agent scalability shows slow degradation in performance.
Increased agents = more competition for MRI, but faster knowledge propagation.
Gossip model is effective for loose coupling.

*/analysis/failure_recovery.md*

**Failure Recovery**

When agents fail, short-term dip in accuracy.
New agents begin with fresh Q-tables but learn from peer-shared data.
System maintains functionality even under aggressive churn.

*/analysis/alternative_approaches.md*

**Alternatives Considered**

Voting-based consensus: discarded due to overhead and delay.
Central rule-based controller: rejected due to centralization.
Shared state memory: avoided to preserve agent autonomy.
